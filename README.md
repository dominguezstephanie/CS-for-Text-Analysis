# CS-for-Text-Analysis
Introduction to Computer Science for Text Analysis Course Work Library

The following work and projects were done for DCS 119. This course reviewed the fundamentals of computer programming in Python, through the development of algorithms that are helpful in answering humanistic questions. Learnings resulted in an understanding of how problem solving using computation works, as well as how to implement that problem solving in the context of creative writing, computational poetry and text analysis.

The outcomes resulted in three large projects:
1) 
2)
3)
